# White Label Server

## Description

This is a starter model for a server using TypeScript, Express, and Prisma as the ORM, with JWT authentication system integrated. It is designed to provide a robust starting point for any server implementations requiring user authentication and database interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You will also need to set up your database and modify the `.env` file to include your database connection string.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the server up and running:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

   ```
2. Initialize Prisma:
   ```bash
   npx prisma init

   ```

This step will create necessary configuration files for Prisma.

3. Configure User Model:
   Before proceeding with the database push, ensure that the User model is properly configured in your Prisma schema.
   Set up the user repository, service layer, and controller for handling user operations.

4. Push Database Changes:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push

   ```

This command pushes the schema model to your database, creating tables as defined.

6. Build the Project:
   ```bash
   npm run build

   ```

This compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript in the dist directory.

6. Start the Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This command runs the compiled JavaScript code starting your server.

Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the defined endpoints as per your route configuration. Use Postman or any other API testing tool to send requests to your server and interact with the API.

Additional Configuration
Environment Variables: Set up your .env file with necessary environment variables such as DATABASE_URL for your database connection and JWT_SECRET for JWT token encryption.
Security Settings: Ensure to configure security settings such as CORS, helmet, and rate limiters as per your production needs.
